# SimpleCode.
### SimpleCode was created for coders who want to use something like Pastebin but Pastebin is not simple in using(I mean various posts, Outstanding API, etc.).
SimpleCode does look like Telegra.ph, because I wanted it to look beautiful.
SimpleCode uses QuillJS and Markdown so you can easily get your text formatted.
Markdown doesn't work nice yet, though =)
# Usage.
### Firstly, install requirements.
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
### Now we want to generate the newest version of documentation.
``` python generate_docs.py ```
### From this moment we have to read docs =) and we wanna create our database.
``` python models.py ```
### Well, now just use this :)
