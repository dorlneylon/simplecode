# SimpleCode.
### SimpleCode was created for coders who want to use something like Pastebin but Pastebin is not simple in using(I mean various posts, Outstanding API, etc.).
SimpleCode does look like Telegra.ph, because I wanted it to look beautiful.
SimpleCode uses Medium Editor so you can easily get your text formatted.
And yeah, you CAN use API to format text. Check /api page to see how.
We **DO** have tables!
# Usage.
### Firstly, install requirements.
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
### Now we want to generate the newest version of documentation.
``` python docs_creator.py ```
### From this moment we have to read docs =)
### Well, now just use this :)
```python start.py```
